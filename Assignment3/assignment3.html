	<p class="auto-style10"><strong>Follow your Passion Wherever it Leads</strong><br>
	Born from a desire for flagship performance and innovation in a more compact 
	and streamlined connected camera, the D7500 delivers the game-changing 
	resolution, ISO range, image processing and energy efficiency of the DX 
	flagship D500 in an enthusiast-level DSLR. Simply put, the D7500 is built to 
	outperform any camera in its class with top-tier image quality, blazing 
	speed, flawless autofocus, 4K Ultra HD video and pro-grade creative 
	tools—all in a comfortable, rugged design. This is a camera for the new 
	generation of creators.<br><br><strong>Bring your Vision to Life</strong><br>
	The D7500 uses the same 20.9 MP DX-format image sensor and EXPEED 5 image 
	processing engine as the D500, taking your photos and videos to the next 
	level. Capture with phenomenal sharpness and tonality, especially in low 
	light situations like concerts, sporting events, parties and events.<br><br>
	<strong>8 FPS Continuous Shooting</strong><br>Improved buffer for shooting 
	RAW. Capture 8 frames per second continuously, up to 100 JPEG Fine frames or 
	up to 50 14-bit lossless compressed RAW frames. With up to 50 RAW shots 
	captured, continue taking photos even while the previous RAW images are 
	being written to the memory card.<br><br><strong>Powerful Focusing System</strong><br>
	Lock on to fast subjects with 51 available focus points, 15 cross-type 
	sensors and group-area AF for sharper, faster detection in low light.<br>
	<br><strong>Brilliant Metering</strong><br>The D7500 uses the same 
	180,000-pixel RGB sensor as the D500 to detect human faces and improve AF 
	performance during high speed shooting.<br><br><strong>Tilting 3.2-inch 
	Touchscreen</strong><br>Tilt the large 3.2-in touchscreen up or down to 
	shoot at high or low angles and simply touch where you want focus when using 
	Live View. Quickly swipe through your shots, pinch to zoom and more.<br><br>
	<strong>Rugged Design</strong><br>The D7500 uses a Monocoque design and 
	extensive weather sealing to withstand moisture, dust and some heavy use.<br>
	<br><strong>Comfortable Performance</strong><br>Slimmer ergonomics and a 
	deeper grip improve stability for handheld shooting and comfort for all day 
	shooting or using telephoto, tele-zoom or all-in-one NIKKOR lenses.<br><br>
	<strong>Up to 950 Shots* on One Battery</strong><br>DSLRs excel at energy 
	efficiency, and the D7500 is particularly efficient. Capture approximately 
	950 shots on a single battery charge.<br><br>*Per CIPA standards, with 
	Bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned off.<br><br><strong>Master the Light</strong><br>
	Add balance, depth and drama to your images with the D7500’s built-in flash, 
	which uses detailed, in-camera scene analysis to add just the right amount 
	of light to your subject. Ready to get even more creative with light? The 
	D7500 has wireless commander capability with up to 2 groups (A/B) of 
	line-of-sight Speedlights or 3 groups (C/D/E) of radio-controlled 
	Speedlights*.<br><br>*With optional WR-R10 wireless remote controller and 
	SB-5000 Speedlight(s).<br><br><strong>4K ultra HD Video</strong><br>If 
	you’ve been itching to enter the world of filmmaking, the D7500 is your 
	gateway DSLR. Record rich and detailed 4K Ultra HD or Full HD videos up to 
	29 minutes 59 seconds through industry-leading NIKKOR lenses while using 
	pro-level video features like power aperture control to adjust aperture 
	while recording and touch focus control. Create beautiful 4K Ultra HD 
	time-lapse movies. Movies can be recorded in MP4 or the conventional MOV 
	format, allowing easy playback on smart devices. The D7500 adjusts to your 
	creative workflow with the freedom to record to an external device, the 
	camera’s memory card or both simultaneously.<br><br><strong>Connected to 
	your World</strong><br>Share your most impressive shots with the world the 
	minute you take them. Install Nikon's SnapBridge app on a compatible phone 
	or tablet and connect to the D7500 for instant photo sharing, automatic 
	backups and even remote camera triggering—great for wildlife shooting, 
	parties, self portraits and group shots with you in them.<br><br><strong>
	Creativity on Demand</strong><br>Beyond its outstanding image capture, the 
	D7500 includes powerful performance enhancing features. In-camera batch 
	processing improves handling of large numbers of RAW images. Auto AF 
	fine-tune in Live View is also inherited from the D500 to simplify 
	adjustment for minor variations between the camera and lens. Advanced 
	Picture Control tools, including a new Auto option; Auto ISO in Manual Mode 
	and Zebra stripes for detecting overblown highlights help you take full 
	creative control. A new and improved multiple exposure feature gives you the 
	choice of saving each individual frame in addition to the final composited 
	image.<br></p>
